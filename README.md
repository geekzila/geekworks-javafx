# geekworks-javafx


Need to have JavaFX installed on your machine.

After installing javafx on your machine check the javafx command on the buildpath. Otherwise the libraries that are used in this project will not be compiled.

Need to add mysql-connector-java-5.1.27.jar in the build path to access the database.

mysql-connector-java-5.1.27.jar download this from maven repository.
